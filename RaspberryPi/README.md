Raspberry Pi
============

This is the repository for all files relating to the Raspberry Pi.  It will be mostly Python.
Currently (Apr 2017) included are many practice files from learning Python and the Raspberry Pi
environment.  These should not be included in any actual build.  If you really want to see my horrible
learning curve, by all means, take a look in /practice.  -niels
